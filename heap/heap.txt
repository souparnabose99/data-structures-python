heaps are basically binary trees
two main binary heap types: min heap and max heap

Heap Properties:
1.) COMPLETENESS: we construct the heap from left to right across 	each row â€“ of course the last row may not be fully complete
2.) HEAP PROPERTY: every node can have 2 children so heaps are almost-complete binary trees.
-> min heap: the parent node is always smaller than
			the child nodes (left and right nodes)
-> max heap: the parent node is always greater than
			the child nodes (left and right nodes)
