Linked List Topics:-  
1. Singly Linked List 
2. Doubly Linked List  
3. Circular Linked List 

Advantages of Linked List over Arrays:
1. No holes in the data strcture
2. Insertion at the start takes O(1) instead of O(N) as in array

Runtime complexity:
Search -> Array: O(1), Linked List: O(N)
Insert at start -> Array: O(N), Linked List: O(1)
Insert at end -> Array: O(1), Linked List: O(N)
Extra space -> Array: 0, Linked List: O(N)
