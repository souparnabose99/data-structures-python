Linked List Topics:-  
1. Singly Linked List 
2. Doubly Linked List  
3. Circular Linked List 

Advantages of Linked List over Arrays:
1. No holes in the data strcture
2. Insertion at the start takes O(1) instead of O(N) as in array

Runtime complexity:
Search -> Array: O(1), Linked List: O(N)
Insert at start -> Array: O(N), Linked List: O(1)
Insert at end -> Array: O(1), Linked List: O(N)
Extra space -> Array: 0, Linked List: O(N)

Linked List Applications:- 
1. alt+tab command in Windows
2. Windows photo viewer
3. Browser pages, all these above are doubly linked list
4. Block chain network

Doubly Linked List:-
1. Can traverse both forward and backward
2. Insertion & deletion at start and end both take O(1) runtime complexity
3. Needs more memory as it stores 2 pointers

Circular Linked List:-
1. No Null reference is present
