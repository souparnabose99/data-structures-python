Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of root node, parent and child/leaf nodes. We have access to root node, all other nodes can be accessed via the root node.
It is an undirected graph G(V,E) in which any 2 vertices are connected by exactly 1 path, equivalent to a connected undirected acyclic graph.

Searching for an arbitrary item takes O(logN) for trees compared to O(N) in arrays and linked list.

Height : No of edges on the longest downward path from the root node to the leaf nodes.
If h=Log(N), then the tree is balanced and O(logN) is maintained

Binary Search Trees (BST) :
1. Every node in the tree can have atmost 2 children
2. Left child is smaller than the parent node
3. Right child is greater tahn the parent node
4. We can access root node exclusively, all other nodes can be accessed exclusively via the root node
